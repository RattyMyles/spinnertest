## What is a Spinner? 
In Android, Spinner provides a quick way to select one value from a set of values. Android spinners are nothing but the drop down-list seen in other programming languages. In a default state, a spinner shows its currently selected value. It provides a easy way to select a value from a list of values.

## What is a TextView? 
In Android, TextView displays text to the user and optionally allows them to edit it programmatically. TextView is a complete text editor, however basic class is configured to not allow editing but we can edit it.

## What is a ScrollView? 
The ScrollView is a generic scrolling container that can host multiple components and views. The scrollable items need not be homogeneous, and you can scroll both vertically and horizontally (by setting the horizontal property).
